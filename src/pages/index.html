        <p>When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude
          of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing
          work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is
          equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen
          reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.</p>
